Subway Stopper - L train

This application connects with the MTA realtime data feed to bring up-to-date train arrival information along stops on the L-train.

Features:
	-Main list presents all L-train stops, their destination, and the number of minutes until the next train arrival.
	-Stop specific window gives to-the-second information on the arrival times of all trains en route to that stop.
	-All information is updated continuously to make sure UI is up to date.
	-Countinues to count down when there is no internet connection so UI is not affected by the change. Toast message appears to notify network disconnection and time on main list appears as NA. Updates automatically at network reconnection
	
Known Bugs:
	-Two stops for which there is no arrival time information appear on the list and are clickable
	-Toast appears everwhere when there is no network connection.
	-Intermittant problems loading fresh minute data on main list
	
Notes:
	-Contrary to information presented on the MTA website, only L-train information appears on their datafeed.
